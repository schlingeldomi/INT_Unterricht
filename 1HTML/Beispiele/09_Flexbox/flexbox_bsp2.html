      Most grid systems today use one of two layout methods: float or inline-block. But neither of these methods were really intended to be used for layout and as a result have pretty significant problems and limitations. Using floats requires clearing them which has a whole host of layout issues, most notoriously that clearing an element sometimes forces it below an unrelated part of the page (take this Bootstrap issue for example). In addition, clearing floats usually requires using both before and after pseudo-elements, preventing you from using them for something else. Inline block layouts must address the problem of white-space between inline-block items, and all of the solutions to that problem are hacky and annoying. Flexbox not only eliminates these problems, it opens up an entirely new world of possibilities.

      Features of a Flexbox Grid System Grid systems usually come with a myriad of sizing options, but the vast majority of the time you just want two or three elements side-by-side. Given this, why should we be required to put sizing classes on every single cell? Listed below are some of my criteria for an ideal grid system. Fortunately, with Flexbox we get most of these features for free.

      Responsive Responsive Grids work by adding media classes to the Grid cells or containers. When those media values are met, the grids automatically adjust accordingly. The cells below should be full width by default and scaled to fit above 48em. Resize your browser to see them in action.
