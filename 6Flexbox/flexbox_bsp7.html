      Most grid systems today use one of two layout methods: float or inline-block. But neither of these methods were really intended to be used for layout and as a result have pretty significant problems and limitations. Using floats requires clearing them which has a whole host of layout issues, most notoriously that clearing an element sometimes forces it below an unrelated part of the page (take this Bootstrap issue for example). In addition, clearing floats usually requires using both before and after pseudo-elements, preventing you from using them for something else. Inline block layouts must address the problem of white-space between inline-block items, and all of the solutions to that problem are hacky and annoying. Flexbox not only eliminates these problems, it opens up an entirely new world of possibilities.
